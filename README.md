This repository contains several codes I wrote and used for stellar astrophysics research during my undergraduate studies at SUNY Oswego. In general, these codes process output data from Modules Experiments for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) ['m an inline-style link](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJS..192....3P/abstract), a modern stellar evolutionary code that solves the differnetial equations that describe stellar structure, and its added functionality Radial Stellar Pulsations (RSP), a 1D radiation hydrodynamics code used to model the nonlinear radial stellar pulsations that characterize RR Lyrae, Cepheids, and other classes of variable stars.

Codes with keyword 'CMD' Code create color-magnitude diagrams using absolute magnitude data from MESA. 

Codes with 'hif2' were originally written by Dr. Earl Bellinger. These codes perform calculations regarding the hydrogen ionization front in stars and plot optical depth vs star age diagrams in addition to Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams.
