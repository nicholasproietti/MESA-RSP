This repository contains several codes I wrote and used for stellar astrophysics research during my undergraduate studies at SUNY Oswego. In general, these codes process output data from [Modules Experiments for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJS..192....3P/abstract), a modern stellar evolutionary code that solves the differnetial equations that describe stellar structure, and its added functionality [Radial Stellar Pulsations (RSP)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJS..243...10P/abstract), a 1D radiation hydrodynamics code used to model the nonlinear radial stellar pulsations that characterize RR Lyrae, Cepheids, and other classes of variable stars.

Codes with keyword 'CMD' Code create color-magnitude diagrams using absolute magnitude data from MESA. 

Codes with 'hif2' were originally written by [Dr. Earl Bellinger](https://github.com/earlbellinger). These codes perform calculations regarding the hydrogen ionization front in stars and plot optical depth vs star age diagrams in addition to Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams.

RSP_interior_LC_plotter uses nonlinear RSP calculations and data to visualize interior luminosity and absolute magnitude light curves of variable stars.
