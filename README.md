This repository contains several codes I wrote and used for stellar astrophysics research during my undergraduate studies at SUNY Oswego. In general, these codes process output data from Modules Experiments for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics and its added functionality Radial Stellar Pulsations. Codes with keyword 'CMD' Code create color-magnitude diagrams using absolute magnitude data from MESA. Codes with 'hif2' were originally written by Dr. Earl Bellinger. These codes perform calculations regarding the hydrogen ionization front in stars and plot optical depth vs star age diagrams in addition to Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams.
